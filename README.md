# Parks and plants

Let’s code a Rails app with gardens and plants!

### User Stories

- [x] As a user I can see one garden's plants
- [ ] As a user I can add a plant in a garden
- [ ] As a user I can delete a plant

### Frontend setup

Follow our front-end setup [guidelines](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-stylesheets/blob/master/README.md) but don’t bother with the Bootstrap JS part, we won’t use any JS here.

### Model

We have two models here `Garden` with `name` and `banner_url`, and `Plant` with `name` and `image_url`. Let's draw the DB.

On `Garden` and `Plant`, all fields are required.
